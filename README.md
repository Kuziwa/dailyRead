Dailly bible reading program

This is an electronic version of the daily bible reading cards distributed by Celebration Churches International.

The reading programme is just an initial step in an amitious project that will soon include versions of the bible for on/offline reading on the go; bookmarking; note taking; prayer network; word network. 

The word rocks and it should be easily accessible daily. Get into the Word and let the Word get into you.
